description: "14+ years of Ruby on Rails. I solve hard backend problems and ship production systems."
---

I've spent 14 years building and scaling Ruby on Rails applications. I've seen codebases at their worst — tangled migrations, N+1 queries in production, test suites that take 45 minutes, deployments held together with hope.

I fix these things.

## What I do

- Take a slow Rails app and make it fast
- Untangle legacy code into something a team can maintain
- Build new features end-to-end — models, APIs, background jobs, the works
- Set up CI/CD, monitoring, and deployment pipelines that actually work
- Debug the issue nobody else can figure out

## What I've worked on

- Payment systems processing real money
- Multi-tenant SaaS platforms
- API integrations with third-party services
- Data migrations without downtime
- Performance optimization on high-traffic applications

## How I work

I write clean code, ship often, and communicate clearly. I don't overcomplicate things. If something can be a simple query, it stays a simple query. If something needs a proper abstraction, I'll build one that the next person can actually understand.

I'm available for contract work or full-time roles.
