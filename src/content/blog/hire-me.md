15 years building, scaling, and maintaining applications. 10 of those in Ruby and Rails.

I write clean code, ship often, and communicate clearly.

I resolve issues by making myself redundant. I don't overcomplicate things.

If something can be a simple query or a static page, it stays simple.

I'm available for contract work or full-time roles.
